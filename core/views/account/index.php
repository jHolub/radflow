Pumping test is a basic method for determination aquifer hydraulic parameters. The main hydraulic parameters are evaluated 
the transmissivity and the storativity well, these two main indicators define the basic physical properties of the aquifer. 
Estimation of these parameters is commonly used semi-logarithmic straight-line method, which is based on the assumptions for 
Theis mathematical model. Nevertheless, there are other parameters corresponding real conditions during pumping test, skin 
effect and wellbore storage can occur in a pumping well. Both the skin effect and the wellbore storage were neglecting in 
the Theis model. The evaluation of pumping test data conducted usually a method for obtaining estimates hydraulic parameters, 
skin effect and wellbore storage not comprise. Despite the fact that neglecting of the skin effect and the wellbore storage 
can lead to false analysis of the time-drawdown variation in the pumping well. Due to further related activities, such as 
solutions contaminant transport, where the hydraulic parameters are included and the time but also the energy consumption 
of pumping test data acquisition is desirable to prevent erroneous analysis. The pumping-well data plotted on a 
semi-logarithmic paper two straight lines can obtained, this characteristic shape of the curve indicates the skin effect 
and the wellbore storage influence conducted pumping test. Here the evaluation method is developed to the estimation of 
transmissivity, storativity, skin effect und wellbore storage of pumping test data showing this characteristic curve shape.
